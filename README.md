Project: Class Mates<br/>
Team name: Conquistadors<br/>
Team members & Contributions: <br/>
Dagbegnon Amouzou: Worked on the back-end function of storing data gained from the survey in a database.<br/>
Carlos Tierra: Debugging Front-End Functionality as well as learning Back-End such as Javascript & SQL. <br/>

Goal: Our goal was to create a website that would help students find study partners in larger classess. We chose this project because we realized that, especially in higher level classes, its often hard to find someone to work and study with in the subject. Over the weekend we were able to get a working website with some missing functionality.<br/>

What motivated your team to choose this project? Are there bigger ideas or features for the project that youâ€™d want to implement in the future?<br/>
<br/>
We chose this project because we realized in larger classes it is difficult to find someone to study or work with. As group work is something that many people    benefit from, we wanted to make a solution for it. An additional feature that we want to add is a point system that uses and builds off of the dining hall         point and reward system to encourage more collaboration.<br/>

Tell us about a tricky bug and/or design challenge that you encountered. How did your team tackle it together?<br/>
<br/>
The tricky design challenge the team encountered is fetching data from a database for emails and passwords. This came in the form of learning a new language, SQL, and implementing it with frameworks such as Node.js. This was an extensive process in properly understanding the language and integrating it into the website for it to acquire the email and password databases. <br/>
